## AlchemFEP_FOXO1

### These scripts combine two types of Gromacs topology files:

#### 1st type of top file is hybrid top file prepared by pmx. It contains State A and State B for Alchemical_FEP use.

#### 2nd type of top file is mcpb top file prepared by mcpb.py. Because metal ion forms coordination bonds to protein atoms, this file has new force constants for protein atoms.
